# ArtAnalysis
In the study,  we analyzed the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) data and implemented diverse approaches in exploring the predictability of statistical features and edge detection-based features in classifying artists.

One part of our analysis compared the predictability of image edge features by canny as well as Kaze (which is more preferable); We conducted experiments for decent artist learning with diverse approaches, such as convolutional neural networks, Mahalanobis binary classifier, and SVM.
